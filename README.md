# Bentley-Ottmann Algorithm Implementation
### Created by Coleman Gibson, Kieran Groble, and Jenna Wohlpart

CSSE403 Programming Language Paradigms final project

To build and run:

    stack build
    stack exec final-project-exe


Implements the Bentley-Ottmann Algorithm for finding intersections of line segments,
backed a Red-Black Tree and Priority Queue. We created a Red-Black Tree using dependent typing
to enforce the color invariants at compile time (note - this is not the tree we ultimately
plugged in to Bentley-Ottmann, as we ran out of time to get delete working properly).
